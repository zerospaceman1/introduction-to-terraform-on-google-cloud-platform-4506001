Terraform is an infrastructure management tool that lets you manage and maintain your servers, networking, storage, and more in one centralized set of code. In this course, learn how to use Terraform to manage resources on Google Cloud and take advantage of the benefits of infrastructure as code. Instructor Josh Samuelson guides you through setting up a Terraform code repo using GitHub, shows you how to use Google Cloud with Terraform, and takes you through setting up a workspace in Terraform Cloud using your GitHub repo and Google Cloud credentials. Learn how to explore state files, make changes to your Terraform code, use reusable modules, and clean up your infrastructure when you're done. If you’ve found your Google Cloud infrastructure lacking, join Josh in this course to make sense of it by managing your infrastructure in code.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#_start/end`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The code is built sequentally and the start and end code for each lesson is denoted by the word `start` or `end` in the branch name. 

The `main` and `start` branches contains the starting code for the course and the `end` branch contains the completed code.
